  abstract  = {As monitoring plans for the restoration of Pinus
                  ponderosa forests in the southwestern United States
                  evolve toward examining multifactor ecosystem
                  responses to ecological restoration, designing
                  efficient sampling procedures for understory
                  vegetation will become increasingly important. The
                  objective of this study was to compare understory
                  composition and diversity among thin/burn and
                  control treatments in a P. ponderosa restoration,
                  while simultaneously examining the effects of
                  sampling design and multivariate analyses on which
                  conclusions were based. Using multi-response
                  permutation procedures (MRPP), we tested the null
                  hypothesis of no difference in understory species
                  composition among treatments using different data
                  matrices (e.g., frequency and cover) for two
                  different sampling methods. Treatment differences
                  were subtle and were detected by an intensive 50,
                  1-m(2) subplot sampling method for all data matrices
                  but were not detected by a less intensive
                  point-intercept sampling method for any
                  matrix. Sampling methods examined in this study
                  controlled results of multivariate analyses more
                  than the data matrices used to summarize data
                  generated by a sampling method. We partitioned data
                  into plant life form and native/exotic species
                  categories for MRPP, and this partitioning isolated
                  plant groups most responsible for treatment
                  differences. We also examined the effects of number
                  of 1-m(2) subplots sampled on
                  mean-species-richness/m(2) estimates and found that
                  estimates based on 10 subplots and based on 50
                  subplots were highly correlated (r =
                  0.99). Species-area curves indicated that the 50,
                  1-m(2) subplot sampling method detected the common
                  species of sites but failed to detect the majority
                  of rare species. Additional sampling-design studies
                  are needed to develop single sampling designs that
                  produce multifactor data on plant composition,
                  diversity, and spatial patterns amenable to
                  multivariate analyses as part of monitoring plans of
                  vegetation responses to ecological restoration.},

     as prescribed fire. are receiving renewed interest as forest
     protection strategies in the western United States. The effectiveness
     of fuelbreaks remains a subject of debate because of differing
     fuelbreak objectives, prescriptions for creation and maintenance, and
     their placement in landscapes with differing fire regimes. A
     well-designed fuelbreak will alter the behavior of wildland fire
     entering the fuel-altered zone. Both surface and crown fire behavior
     may be reduced, Shaded fuelbreaks must be created in the context of
     the landscape within which they are placed. No absolute standards for
     fuelbreak width or fuel reduction are possible, although recent
     proposals for forested fuelbreaks suggest 400 m wide bands where
     surface fuels are reduced and crown fuels are thinned,
     Landscape-level treatments such as prescribed fire can use shaded
     fuelbreaks as anchor points, and extend the zone of altered fire
     behavior to larger proportions of the landscape. Coupling fuelbreaks
     with area-wide fuel treatments can reduce the size, intensity, and
     effects of wildland fires. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

     severe fire problems across the West. Not every forest is at risk of
     uncharacteristically severe wildfire, but drier forests are in need
     of active management to mitigate fire hazard. We summarize a set of
     simple principles important to address in fuel reduction treatments:
     reduction of surface fuels, increasing the height to live crown,
     decreasing crown density, and retaining large trees of fire-resistant
     species. Thinning and prescribed fire can be useful tools to achieve
     these objectives. Low thinning will be more effective than crown or
     selection thinning, and management of surface fuels will increase the
     likelihood that the stand will survive a wildfire. Five empirical
     examples of such treatment are discussed: Hayfork fires, California,
     1987; Tyee fire, Washington, 1994; Megram fire, California, 1999;
     Hayman fire, Colorado, 2002; and the Cone fire, California, 2002.
     Applying treatments at an appropriate landscape scale will be
     critical to the success of fuel reduction treatments in reducing
     wildfire losses in Western forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

     (1900-2400 in a.s.l.) and they are rare, occupying < 2% of the land
     in the Basin's watershed. Correlation matrices and ANOVAs of forest

     significant relationships with elevation, distance east of the

     snow melt, litter depth and degree of soil profile development.
     Pathogens, parasites and wood-boring insects were present on 23% of
     living trees; 16% of all trees were dead. We compared these stands to
     a reconstruction of pre-contact Basin forests and to ecologically
     analogous old-growth forests of Baja California that have never
     experienced fire suppression management. Currently, overstorey trees
     (> 180 yr old) in the Basin stands have ca. 33% cover, 54 m(2).ha(-1)
     basal area and 107 individuals.ha(-1), values very similar to
     reconstructions of pre-contact Basin forests and to modern Baja
     California forests. Understorey trees (60-180 yr old), however, are
     several times more dense than historic levels and species composition
     is strongly dominated by A. concolor, regardless of the overstorey
     composition. The ratio of Pinus : Abies has increased - and the age
     structure of extant stands predicts that it will continue to increase
     - from approximately 1:1 in pre-contact time to 1:7 within the next
     century. Disease incidence and mortality in Baja forests were lower.
     Although we quantitatively defined current Basin old-growth forests -
     in terms of stand structure - we realize that our definition will
     differ from that of both past and future old-growth forests unless
     management protocols are changed.},

                  fire regime parameters vary with species composition
                  (tree species), and environment (i.e. slope aspect,
                  slope position, elevation). Location Our study was
                  conducted in the 1587 ha Cub Creek Research Natural
                  Area (CCRNA), Lassen National Forest, CA,
                  USA. Methods We quantified the return interval,
                  seasonal occurrence, size, rotation period, and
                  severity of fires using dendroecology. Results Slope
                  aspect, potential soil moisture, forest composition,
                  and fire regime parameters in our study area
                  co-vary. Median composite and point fire return
                  intervals (FRI) were longest on higher, cooler, more
                  mesic, north-facing (NF) slopes covered with white
                  fir (Abies concolor), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga

                  (A. magnifica)-white fir forests, shortest on the
                  dry, south-facing (SF) slopes covered with ponderosa
                  pine (Pinus ponderosa)-white fir forests and
                  intermediate on west-facing slopes dominated by
                  white fir-sugar pine (P. lambertiana)-incense cedar
                  (Libocedrus decurrens) forests. The spatial pattern
                  for length of fire rotation (FR) was the same as
                  that for FRI. Fires in CCRNA mixed conifer forests
                  occurred mainly (90%) in the dormant season. Size of
                  burns in CCRNA mixed conifer forests were generally
                  small (mean = 106 ha), however, during certain
                  drought years widespread fires burned across fuel
                  breaks and spread throughout the watershed. Fire
                  severity was mainly high on upper slopes, low on
                  lower slopes and moderate and low severity on middle
                  slopes. Patterns of fire severity also varied with
                  slope aspect. Fire frequency decreased dramatically
                  in CCRNA after 1905. Conclusions In CCRNA, fire
                  regime parameters [e.g. FRI, fire extent, FR, fire
                  severity] varied widely with species composition,
                  slope aspect and slope position. There was also
                  temporal variation in fire extent with the most
                  widespread fires occurring during drought years. The
                  important contributions of topography and climate to
                  variation in the fire regime indicates that
                  exogenous factors play a key role in shaping the
                  fire-forest structure mosaic and that the
                  fire-forest structure mosaic is more variable, less
                  predictable and less stable than previously
                  thought. Finally, some characteristics of the fire
                  regime (i.e. fire severity, season of burn) in CCRNA
                  are different than those described for other mixed
                  conifer forests and this suggests that there are
                  geographical differences in mixed conifer fire
                  regimes along the Pacific slope.},

                  habitats that is favored in plants that experience
                  stand-replacing fires within their average life
                  span. Although variation in fire frequency has been
                  the focus of most studies attempting to understand
                  variation in serotiny among populations and species
                  of plants, other factors can select against
                  serotiny. One agent in particular that can select
                  against serotiny is an efficient pre-dispersal seed
                  predator that eats a large fraction of the seeds
                  held in the canopy. To test whether selection by
                  such a predator selects against scrutiny, we
                  compared levels of serotiny in fire-adapted Rocky
                  Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta
                  ssp. latifolia) in five ranges lacking its dominant
                  pre-dispersal seed predator, the pine squirrel
                  (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to 344 stands with pine
                  squirrels. Where pine squirrels were absent, the
                  frequency of serotiny was consistently near 100%,
                  whereas where squirrels were present, the frequency
                  was variable, rarely approached the high levels
                  found in areas without squirrels, and averaged much
                  less than 50%. This indicates that squirrels select
                  against serotiny and that, in the absence of
                  squirrels, the frequency of serotiny would probably
                  be uniformly higher throughout much of the Rocky
                  Mountains. Because serotiny levels also influence
                  the density of seedlings following a fire,
                  squirrels, by selecting strongly against scrutiny,
                  have the potential to alter the early stages and
                  perhaps the course of succession and various
                  community attributes.},

  abstract  = {1. Timber harvesting exemplifies many aspects of experimental
     manipulation in applied ecology. Evaluation of the research
     approaches used to assess ecological effects of harvesting thus has
     relevance to a diverse range of ecological questions that address
     large-scale and human impacts on the environment. 2. We measured the
     frequency of approaches, and also design and statistical issues, in
     assessments of harvesting effects on three response variables (tree
     regeneration, vertebrates and water) in two major native forests of
     south-east Australia. Our evaluation was based on 124 documents that
     contain unique, field-based research and that represent the complete
     written record (published and unpublished) of relevant research prior
     to mid-2002. 3. The dominant approach was contrasts between
     manipulated stands, nearly always involving mature and old-growth
     stands as the reference or control. In studies of tree regeneration,
     focus on wood-production objectives was apparent in the relatively
     frequent use of stocking standards, and in the use of between- and
     within-stand contrasts without a control condition. Comparatively
     greater use of models in vertebrate and water studies suggested more
     frequent integration of generic principles and, in water studies,
     reflected strong collective knowledge based on the repeated use of
     BACI-type designs (i.e. before-after, control-impact) or long-term
     data sets. 4. Statistical issues such as poor reporting of
     experimental designs and of sample statistics were common. Explicit
     hypotheses were rare, and there was no evidence of definition of
     critical effect sizes, use of power analysis or use of non-classical
     statistical approaches (e.g. Bayesian inference). 5. Lack of
     treatment replication was widespread in between-stand contrasts and
     less frequent in within-stand contrasts. Inappropriate interpretation
     of results from non-replicated experimental designs remains an
     ongoing issue. 6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of
     information obtainable from stand-level manipulations of forest would
     substantially increase through greater attention to data quality and
     experimental protocols. Studies require broader experimental
     contexts, including their potential place in meta-replication
     frameworks. Increasingly, constraints of large-scale manipulations
     necessitate the integration of data and the acknowledgement of
     uncertainty in formalized systems (e.g. Bayesian methods and adaptive
     management frameworks). Our evaluation suggests the alternative is a
     perpetuation of short-term, isolated studies that repeat errors and
     have limited potential to refine knowledge on the ecological effects
     of timber harvesting and other similarly scaled disturbances.},

                  Arizona. To understand the reaction of a relatively
                  immobile guild of species to a wildfire, we
                  pit-trapped lizards from 1996 to 1999 in both burned
                  and unburned interior chaparral and Madrean
                  evergreen forest. In 26,214 trap nights, we found
                  relative abundance was up to 10 times greater in
                  burned than unburned vegetation. Species richness
                  and diversity values were also greater in burned
                  sites. Our data indicate a rapid settlement of
                  burned areas primarily by individuals that survived
                  the fire. Increased capture rate, diversity and
                  richness values in 1998 and 1999 indicate that many
                  species of lizards may even prefer early
                  successional stages in chaparral and Madrean
                  evergreen forests. Resident species of Teiidae and
                  Sceloporus undulatus were more adapted to disturbed

                  yr B.P., the vegetation of the southern San Joaquin
                  Valley (central California) resembled that of the
                  contemporary Great Basin, including abundant
                  greasewood (Sarcobatus), which currently does not
                  occur west of the Sierra Nevada. The early-Holocene
                  pollen assemblage is dominated by Cupressaceae
                  (>40%), Pinus (>20%), Quercus (5-20%), Artemisia
                  (>15%), and Sarcobatus (>5%), suggesting
                  pinyon-juniper-oak woodland in the uplands, with
                  greasewood on the saltflats near the lake. Giant
                  sequoia was widespread along the Sierra Nevada
                  streams draining into Tulare Lake, prior to 9000 yr
                  B.P. as Sequoiadendron pollen is greater than
                  4%. The pollen assemblages before 18,500 yr B.P. are
                  similar to those of the early Holocene
                  (Cupressaceae, Artemisia, and Sarcobatus), but a gap
                  in sedimentation from ca. 18,500-10,500 yr
                  B.P. prohibits characterization of full-glacial
                  vegetation. The end of Great Basin-like pollen
                  assemblages 7000 yr B.P. (demise of Sarcobatus)
                  coincides with increased frequency of charcoal;
                  i.e., greater fire frequency in the Holocene
                  woodland and grassland. From 7000-4000 yr B.P. the
                  pollen assemblage is dominated by Other Compositae
                  and Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthus pollen, suggesting
                  expansion of xerophytic steppe at the expense of oak
                  woodland. Higher percentages of littoral pollen
                  (Cyperaceae, Typha-Sparganium) and lower percentages
                  of pelagic algae (Botryococcus + Pediastrum) during
                  the middle Holocene indicate lake levels generally
                  lower than during the early Holocene. The late
                  Holocene begins with a cold-wet period 3500-2500 yr
                  B.P. followed by progressive drying of the
                  lake. Climate estimates based on modern pollen
                  analogs confirm the climate implications of the
                  vegetation and lake history. Early Holocene climate
                  was cold and wet, and maximum Holocene temperature
                  and drought occurred between 7000 and 4000 yr
                  B.P. Cool-moist climate from 4000 to 2000 yr B.P. is

  abstract  = {Fire performs many beneficial ecosystem functions in dry
     forests and rangelands across much of North America. In the last
     century, however, the role of fire has been dramatically altered by
     numerous anthropogenic factors acting as root causes of the current
     fire crisis, including widespread logging, road building, fire
     suppression, habitat fragmentation, urban development, livestock
     grazing, and, more recently, climate change. The intensity and extent
     of fires in the western United States, specifically, have
     dramatically increased over the past several decades. Such shifts in
     fire behavior have triggered sweeping policy changes that were
     intended to prevent or contain fires but that pose significant risks
     to the integrity of ecosystems and the role fire historically played
     in shaping them. Here, we provide a social and ecological context for
     summarizing this special issue on fires, including general guidelines
     and principles for managers concerned about balancing the risks of
     inaction against the risks of action over extensive areas.
     Fundamental to our understanding of fire is the notion that it is
     extremely variable, has multiple causes, and requires ecological
     solutions that are sensitive to spatial scale and context Therefore,
     forest managers must recognize that different forest types have
     different fire regimes and require fundamentally different fire-
     management policies. Furthermore, to restore or maintain ecological
     integrity, including the role of fire, treatments need to be tailored
     to site-specific conditions with an adaptive approach. We provide a
     conceptual framework for prioritizing fuel treatments and restoration
     activities in the wildlands-urban intermix versus those in wildland
     areas farther from human settlement. In general, the science of
     conservation biology has much to offer in helping to shape wildfire
     policy direction; however, conservation biologists must become more
     engaged to better ensure that policy decisions are based on sound
     science and that ecological risks are incorporated.},

     herb patterns were structurally similar to those of shrubs/trees

     correlated with edaphic factors. Abundance data were collected within
     quadrats placed along transects from upslope savannas through
     mid-slope seepage bogs into lower-slope shrub/tree zones within
     Louisiana and Florida. beta-flexible cluster analysis and nonmetric
     multidimensional scaling were used to delineate herbaceous species
     communities. Ordination was performed separately on shrub/tree
     abundance data. The herb-based classifications were also used to
     delineate shrub/tree communities, providing an indirect means of
     comparing herb to shrub/tree distributions. In Louisiana, three
     herbaceous communities were sharply delineated along elevation
     gradients of several meters and were strongly correleated with soil
     moisture. In Florida, three similar herbaceous communities were less
     discrete along elevation gradients of < 1 meter. In both regions,
     shrub/tree distributions were much broader and appeared less
     sensitive than herbs to changes in environmental gradients.
     Coefficients of variation indicated that, in general, herbaceous
     species were more narrowly distributed than shrubs/trees along
     localized elevation gradients in both Louisiana and Florida.

     have been explored for trees in southeastern longleaf pine (Pines
     palustris) savannas, responses of other life forms and stages have
     not been studied. We examined effects of fire season and frequency,
     geography, habitat, and underground organ morphology on resprouting
     of shrubs. In 1994, we located replicated sites, each containing two
     habitats, upslope savannas and downslope seepages, in Louisiana and
     Florida. Each site, which contained quadrats located along transects
     within a 30 X 60 m plot, was burned either during the dormant or
     growing season and then reburned similarly two years later. Maximum
     fire temperatures were measured, and densities of shrub stems were
     censused in quadrats before and after fires. Shrubs collectively
     resprouted more following dormant than growing-season fires,
     regardless of habitat or geographic region. After repeated
     dormant-season fires, collective densities in seepages of both
     regions and densities of root-crown-bearing shrubs in Florida
     seepages were greater than those initially and after repeated
     growing-season fires. Shrub responses were generally unrelated to
     fire temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that resprouting of
     shrubs may be more dependent on their physiological status at the
     time of fires. There was, nonetheless, an inverse relationship
     between collective and root-crown-bearing shrub densities following
     repeated fires and maximum fire temperatures in Florida seepages.
     Anthropogenic dormant-season fires over many decades may have
     resulted in increases in shrub densities in longleaf pine savannas,
     especially seepages. Repeated growing-season fires, however, neither
     increased nor reduced densities of established shrubs. Long-term
     shifts in characteristics of fire regimes, even in fire-frequented
     habitats, may produce effects that are not reversible in the short
     term (<10 yr) by simply reintroducing prescribed fires that resemble
     those that occurred naturally during the growing season.},

     explored this hypothesis by examining fire season and intensity
     effects on response of Prosopis glandulosa, a resprouting shrub in
     Chihuahuan desert grasslands of the south-western United States.
     Clipping as well as low and high intensity fires ( natural and added
     fuels, respectively) were applied during the 1999 growing season and
     the 2000 dormant season. Both fire season and intensity affected
     shrub responses. Numbers of resprouts increased 16%, and heights
     increased 8% after dormant season versus growing season treatments of
     fire and clipping combined. Height and resprout number decreased with
     increased fire intensity. Fire season and intensity effects on canopy
     area and stem growth were generally not detected. My results do not
     support the above hypothesis. Instead, fire season and intensity
     influence shrub responses in different ways via different mechanisms.
     Prosopis glandulosa has the potential to respond more after dormant
     season than growing season fires, perhaps as determined by
     carbohydrate availability in underground organs at the time of fire.
     However, realization of this potential is contingent on fire
     intensity as influenced primarily by fuel amount. In turn, fire
     intensity will determine the amount and duration of heat penetration
     into soils and thus the amount of damage to growing points of
     underground organs.},

     management-ignited fire in a dense, never-harvested forest in Grand
     Canyon National Park escaped prescription and burned with greater
     intensity and severity than anticipated. We sampled the burned site
     and an adjacent unburned site (270 ha each) 6 years after the fire to
     assess burn effects on tree structure (species composition, size and
     age distributions, regeneration, and snags), forest floor fuels, and
     coarse woody debris. Tree structure before fire-regime disruption

     and basal area (28.5 m(2) /ha) to levels similar to pre-European
     reference conditions (approximately 246 trees/ha and 28.5 m(2)/ha).
     Mortality was concentrated in fire-susceptible species, especially

     structures, assessing the influence of factors that caused ecological
     change and evaluating remote sites as relatively natural areas.
     Location Grand Canyon National Park contains the largest
     never-harvested and long-term ungrazed forest ecosystem in Arizona,
     providing valuable sites for measuring natural variability. However,
     anthropogenic disruption of natural fire regimes since Euro-American
     settlement c. 1880 has led to changes in forest structure. Methods We
     compared species composition, tree structure, regeneration, and
     canopy cover on large (135-603 ha) ponderosa pine-dominated study
     sites: (1) isolated points on the North Rim where some surface fires
     continued after 1880, (2) a higher-elevation North Rim site where
     fire has been excluded and (3) a South Rim site, also without recent
     fire, with a paired Kaibab National Forest site. Forest tree
     structure prior to fire-regime disruption was reconstructed with
     dendroecological techniques. Results Before fire exclusion, all sites
     had relatively low tree density (140-246 trees ha(-1)) dominated by
     large trees (basal area 9.1-28.5 m(2) ha(-1)), primarily ponderosa
     pine or pine/Gambel oak on the South Rim. Currently all sites are
     relatively dense (389955 trees ha(-1), 14.1-41.3 m(2) ha(-1)) but
     patterns of species composition and regeneration differed
     substantially with fire regime and elevation. Regeneration at
     continued-fire sites was primarily through sprouting species, Gambel
     oak and New Mexican locust, forming a shrubby midstorey under a
     relatively open pine canopy. In contrast, all fire-excluded sites
     were dense with seed-reproducing conifer species. Main conclusions
     Comparison of change caused by climate fluctuation, tree cutting,
     fire exclusion, livestock herbivory, and wildlife herbivory, suggests
     that fire regime alteration appears to have played the greatest role.
     The remote North Rim sites provide a close analogue to conditions
     prior to fire regime disruption, a contemporary example of the forest
     characteristics that might have been extant had recent human-caused
     disruption of disturbance regimes and heavy resource extraction not
     occurred. They merit broader study of natural variability on a range
     of ecological variables in ponderosa pine ecosystems.},

     prescribed burning, (2) minimal thinning (MIN)-removing young trees

     CONTROL. Each treatment was applied to a 12 ha unit. Compared to
     reconstructed 1887 conditions, all study sites were much more dense
     prior to treatment (94-176 trees/ha in 1887, compared to 783-3693

     (12.6-20.3 in 1887, 17.5-27.0 m(2)/ha in 1997), reflecting past
     harvest and dwarf mistletoe reduction treatments that removed many

     years, probably due to a severe drought in 2000 (60% of average
     precipitation). No differences in plant communities were observed
     across treatments, despite the mechanized disturbance associated with
     tree removal in the FULL treatment. Prescribed fire behavior (flame
     length, flaming zone depth) and effects (bole char, crown scorch)
     were similar across all three burned treatments. Simulated fire
     behavior under dry, windy conditions was reduced in all three
     treatments compared to the control. The FULL treatment was much less
     susceptible to crownfire due to reduced crown bulk density and crown
     fuel load and increased crown base height. Crownfire susceptibility
     of the BURN treatment was only slightly reduced, while the MIN
     treatment was intermediate. Compared to the reference conditions of
     forest structure, the FULL treatment represented the most rapid and
     comprehensive restoration treatment, although the residual stand was
     at the low end of historical density. The BURN treatment thinned many
     small trees but had minor effects on crownfire susceptibility.
     Effects of the MIN treatment fell between FULL and BURN. The
     experimental treatments may be useful for the creation of defensible
     firebreaks near developments, roads, and boundaries with the FULL
     treatment, supplemented by MIN and BURN treatments over larger areas.

     North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Arizona, were reconstructed from fire
     scar analysis, remote sensing, tree age, and forest structure
     measurements, a first attempt at detailed reconstruction of the
     transition from surface to stand-replacing fire patterns in the
     Southwest. Tree densities and fire-/non-fire-initiated groups were
     highly mixed over the landscape, so distinct fire-created stands
     could not be delineated from satellite imagery or the oldest
     available aerial photos. Surface fires were common from 1700 to 1879
     in the 4,400 ha site, especially on S and W aspects. Fire dates
     frequently coincided with fire dates measured at study sites at lower
     elevation, suggesting that pre-1880 fire sizes may have been very
     large. Large fires, those scarring 25% or more of the sample trees,
     were relatively infrequent, averaging 31 years between burns. Four of
     the five major regional fire years occurred in the 1700s, followed by
     a 94-year gap until 1879. Fires typically occurred in significantly
     dry years ( Palmer Drought Stress Index), with severe drought in
     major regional fire years. Currently the forest is predominantly
     spruce-fir, mixed conifer, and aspen. In contrast, dendroecological
     reconstruction of past forest structure showed that the forest in
     1880 was very open, corresponding closely with historical ( 1910)
     accounts of severe fires leaving partially denuded landscapes. Age
     structure and species composition were used to classify sampling
     points into fire-initiated and non-fire-initiated groups. Tree groups
     on nearly 60% of the plots were fire-initiated; the oldest such
     groups appeared to have originated after severe fires in 1782 or
     1785. In 1880, all fire-initiated groups were less than 100 years old
     and nearly 25% of the groups were less than 20 years old.
     Non-fire-initiated groups were significantly older ( oldest 262 years
     in 1880), dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, or white fir, and
     occurred preferentially on S and W slopes. The mixed-severity fire
     regime, transitioning from lower-elevation surface fires to mixed
     surface and stand-replacing fire at higher elevations, appeared not
     to have been stable over the temporal and spatial scales of this
     study. Information about historical fire regime and forest structure
     is valuable for managers but the information is probably less
     specific and stable for high-elevation forests than for low-elevation
     ponderosa pine forests.},

  abstract  = {We applied detailed forest reconstructions measured on
     broad-scale plot grids to initialize forest simulation modeling in
     1880 and modeled spatially explicit changes in canopy fuels (canopy
     biomass, canopy bulk density, species composition) and potential fire
     behavior (crowning index) through 2040, a 160-year period. The study
     sites spanned a 500-m elevational gradient from ponderosa pine forest
     through higher-elevation mixed conifer, aspen, and spruce-fir forests
     on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona.
     The simulations were relatively accurate, as assessed by comparing
     the simulation output in the year 2000 with field data collected in
     1997-2001, because a regionally calibrated simulator was used
     (Central Rockies variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator) and
     because we added regeneration by species and density in the correct
     historical sequence. Canopy biomass increased at all sites, rising an
     average of 122% at the low-elevation sites and 279% at the
     high-elevation sites. The intermediate-elevation site, where mixed
     conifer vegetation predominated, began with the highest canopy
     biomass in 1880 but had the lowest increase through 2040 (39%).
     Canopy bulk density increased roughly in parallel with canopy
     biomass; however, density values were considered less accurate in
     non-contemporary dates because they were based on assumptions about
     canopy volume. Species composition of canopy fuels was consistent at
     low elevation (ponderosa pine) but shifted strongly toward mesic
     species at higher elevations, where ponderosa pine declined in
     absolute as well as relative terms. Potential crown fire behavior was
     assessed with the Nexus model in terms of crowning index (CI), the
     windspeed required to sustain active canopy burning. CI values
     decreased 23-80% over the modeled period. Canopy fuel and CI values
     were mapped across the entire North Rim landscape. At a threshold
     windspeed of 45 km/h, only 6% of the landscape was susceptible to
     active crown fire in 1880 but 33% was susceptible by 2000.
     Implications of the changes over time and space include altered
     contemporary habitats and the high likelihood of rapid, broad-scale
     disturbance by fire. If managers choose to intervene to reduce canopy
     fuel mass and continuity, actions should be guided by the distinct
     ecological attributes of the different forest types. (C) 2003

     with cumulative sample curves, effectiveness of fire recording on
     individual trees, tree age data, and the occurrence of 20th Century
     fires which permitted comparison of fire-scar data with fire- record
     data, a form of modern calibration for the interpretation of fire-
     scar results. Fire scars identified all 13 recorded fires > 8 ha on
     the study sites since 1924, when record keeping started. Records of
     fire season and size corresponded well with fire- scar data. We
     concluded that the sampling and analysis methods were appropriate and
     accurate for this area, in contrast to the suggestion that these
     methods are highly uncertain in ponderosa pine forests. Prior to
     1880, fires were most frequent on low-elevation 'islands' of
     ponderosa pine forest formed by plateaus or points ( Weibull Median
     Probability Intervals [WMPI] 3.0-3.9 years for all fires, 6.3-8.6
     years for 'large' fires scarring 25% or more of the sampled trees).
     Fires were less frequent on a higher-elevation 'mainland' site
     located further to the interior of the North Rim ( WMPI 5.1 years all
     fires, 8.7 years large fires), but fires tended to occur in
     relatively drier years and individual fires were more likely to burn
     larger portions of the study site. In contrast to the North Rim
     pattern of declining fire frequency with elevation, a low-elevation
     'mainland' site on the South Rim had the longest fire- free intervals
     prior to European settlement (WMPI 6.5 years all fires, 8.9 years
     large fires). As in much of western North America, surface fire
     regimes were interrupted around European settlement, 1879 on the
     North Rim and 1887 on the South Rim. However, either two or three
     large surface fires have burned across each of the geographically
     remote point and plateau study sites of the western North Rim since
     settlement. To some extent, these sites may be rare representatives
     of nearly-natural conditions due to the relatively undisrupted fire
     regimes in a never-harvested forest setting.},

     one stand had 120 years of artificial fire exclusion (NOBURN) and the

     BURN-W). These forests are valuable places to gauge anthropogenic
     changes associated with European settlement, due to their land
     history of limited livestock grazing and no logging. Precipitation
     varied greatly between sampling years (260 mm in 2000, 505 mm in
     2001). Tree density was significantly higher at NOBURN (1424 trees
     ha(-1)) with significantly higher rotten coarse woody debris (23.2 Mg
     ha(-1)) and duff depth (4.3 cm) than at the burned sites, as expected
     in the absence of fire. Although species richness was not
     significantly different among sites (48-89 species), richness
     differed significantly by year. Shannon's index of diversity
     increased by approximately 10% from the dry year to the wet year on
     all sites. Community composition and plant cover at NOBURN differed
     significantly from the two burned sites in both years in non-metric
     multidimensional scaling ordinations. Increasing duff depth was
     related to decreased plant cover. Two of the three dominant species
     were different at the fire-excluded site compared to the burned
     sites. We conclude that although plant community structure was
     related to fire history, environmental stress and within-stand
     variability were also important drivers. We suggest selecting
     reference sites in close proximity to the site to be restored and
     using a multi-scale, multi-year, multi-site approach to measure
     reference conditions in ponderosa pine.},

                  structure of the dominant overstory was inferred
                  from the size and spatial patterning of stumps,
                  logs, snags, and live trees (greater than 140 years
                  of age) within 48 0.5 ha plots. Size class
                  distributions, basal area, and spatial distribution
                  of historical trees were compared among plant
                  association groups representing a range of
                  environmental conditions. Using spatial point
                  pattern analysis, we found that significant clumping
                  at fine scales (0-15 m) existed
                  historically. Spatial patterning of present day and
                  historical trees of four comparable plots suggests
                  that while strong clumping exists in present day
                  stands, the largest trees today exhibit less
                  clumping than did large historical trees. Historical
                  SDI (260) for dominant overstories was nearly the
                  same as threshold for serious beetle mortality (263)
                  for ponderosa pine. Cut-tree marking was carried out
                  within 15 m radius circles, as guided by the spatial
                  patterning analysis, and using a sliding scale of
                  trees per circle by quadratic mean diameter. }

  abstract  = {Resources for prescribed fire are frequently insufficient to
     manage public lands for all conservation and resource management
     objectives, necessitating prioritization of the application of fire
     across the landscape within any given year. Defining tradeoffs when
     applying prescribed fire to large landscapes is problematic not only
     because of the complexity of weighing competing management objectives
     at the landscape scale, but also because of the difficult nature of
     independently applying need-to-burn criteria to large areas. We
     present a case study of a simple modeling process implemented at
     Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle (U. S. A.) to
     prioritize the application of prescribed fire. In a workshop setting,
     managers and biologists identified key conservation criteria and
     landscape management objectives that drive the application of
     prescribed fire. Remote sensing and other spatial data were developed
     to directly or indirectly represent all these criteria. Using
     geographic information system software, managers and biologists
     weighted each criterion according to its relative contribution to
     overall burn prioritization, and individual values for the criterion
     were scored according to how they influence the need to burn.
     Subsequently, this process has been validated and modified through
     ecological monitoring. This modeling process has also been applied to
     the 77,400-ha Blackwater River State Forest, public land adjacent to
     Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrating its applicability to lands with
     varying management priorities. The advantages of this model-based
     approach for prioritizing prescribed fire include the reliance on
     accessible, inexpensive software, the development of spatially
     explicit management objectives, the ease of transferability, and
     clearly stated assumptions about management that may be tested and
     reviewed through monitoring and public comment.},

                  the southwest but little research has examined
                  constraints on population-level responses of
                  understory plants. In order to study growth and
                  reproduction of a common shrub species after forest
                  restoration treatments, we monitored Fendler
                  ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri Gray) plants from 1999
                  to 2002 in thinned and unthinned overstory units. To
                  study effects of tree thinning, we analyzed
                  relationships of overstory stand density (Reineke's
                  SDI) and current-year branch length. number of
                  branches, and biomass, and also evaluated the
                  importance of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and
                  Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) herbivory
                  (Browsing) as a predictor in linear models. To study
                  effects of prescribed fire, we examined mortality,
                  seedling emergence, and growth response on
                  experimentally burned and unburned plots. SDI and
                  browsing were significantly and negatively
                  correlated with F. ceanothus current-year branch
                  length, biomass, and leaf area but relationships
                  were generally weak. Across the 4 years, browsing
                  appeared to be consistently more important than SDI
                  in explaining variation in growth. Although SDI and
                  browsing were significant predictors of growth in
                  years with near normal precipitation, models failed
                  in drought years. Burning resulted in 17-32%
                  mortality whereas 0-5% of plants died on unburned
                  plots. Mortality of burned plants was positively
                  related to amount of forest floor consumed during
                  prescribed fires. One growing season after fire,
                  surviving burned plants responded by producing long
                  resprouts. Current-year branches were consistently
                  longer on burned than unburned plants only where
                  plots were protected from large herbivores. Unburned
                  plants had more current-year branches and greater
                  biomass than burned plants. No seedlings emerged on
                  unburned plots but were found on 44% of burned
                  plots. A quadratic function represented the
                  relationship between seedling emergence and forest
                  floor consumption. Our results suggest that
                  restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests of
                  nor-them Arizona can help increase abundance of
                  F. ceanothus but population responses may be slow,

     Measurements were made in a second-growth ponderosa pine forest in
     northern Arizona where the basal area treatments (6.9, 18.4, 27.6,
     78.2 m(2) ha(-1)) have been experimentally maintained by frequent
     thinnings for 32 years before our measurements began in 1994. Most of
     the physiological characteristics measured were affected by the basal
     area treatments. As stand basal area increased from 6.9 to 78.2 m(2)
     ha(-1), predawn water potential, midday water potential, net
     photosynthetic rate, resin production, phloem thickness, and foliar
     toughness decreased. Foliar nitrogen concentration was greatest in
     trees in the intermediate basal area treatments. Our results show
     that the physiological condition of second-growth ponderosa pine can
     be manipulated by silvicultural control of stand basal area, and
     support the hypothesis that high stand basal area increases tree
     stress and decreases tree resistance to insect attack.},

                  forests. Based on theory, we expected belowground
                  competition to be intense in a region with low
                  summer rainfall, and trench responses were expected
                  to be greater in the high light environment of the
                  gaps. We installed I in deep trenches around study
                  plots and lined the trenches to prevent reinvasion
                  by tree roots. Soil moisture was measured monthly
                  during the growing season for the first 3 years
                  after trench installation. Vegetation in these
                  trenched plots was compared with control plots 10
                  years after installation of the plots. Trenched
                  plots with no vegetation manipulation averaged 92%
                  total understory cover, while untrenched plots
                  averaged 47% cover. Contrary to our expectation,
                  both vegetation and soil moisture responses to
                  trenching were greater in areas of high tree canopy
                  cover than in gaps. Trenched plots under, closed
                  canopies were moister than control plots throughout
                  the growing season, while the trenching effect
                  became apparent in the overall wetter gaps only at
                  the end of the growing season. We conclude that
                  understory plants at these sites were limited at
                  least as much by belowground competition as by
                  aboveground competition.},

                  communities of pre-commercially thinned and
                  unthinned young- and old-growth Douglas-fir
                  (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands. Sites were located
                  in the Cascade Mountains of western Oregon. Young
                  stands were approximately 40 years old at the time
                  of sampling; thinning occurred 20 years
                  earlier. Although tree spacing was wider in thinned
                  than in unthinned stands, faster tree growth in
                  thinned stands meant that thinning had no long-term
                  effect on basal area of P. menziesii. The very
                  large, widely spaced P. menziesii individuals in
                  old-growth stands contributed similar basal area as
                  the smaller trees in young stands; however, old
                  stands had much higher basal area of shade-tolerant
                  conifers. Although low shrubs responded positively
                  to thinning, the difference in cover between thinned
                  and unthinned stands was too small to be
                  statistically significant. Ordination of sample
                  plots in terms of their understory shrub and herb
                  species composition identified a strong gradient in
                  community composition from young to old-growth
                  stands. Understory species associated with old
                  growth included both gap specialists and those that
                  may be dependent on the litter depth and mycorrhizal
                  fungi of old-growth forest floors. Although both
                  thinned and unthinned young stand composition were
                  quite distinct from that of old-growth stands,
                  thinned stands were more similar to old growth than
                  were unthinned stands. Thinned stands had higher
                  frequency of late-seral herbs than did unthinned
                  stands. Forest generalist and release species showed
                  mixed responses to thinning. We conclude that
                  pre-commercial thinning may be a useful management
                  toot to encourage old growth associated understory
                  herbs without precipitating dominance of the
                  understory by low shrubs and weedy species. Although
                  thinning did accelerate tree growth, changes in the
                  understory appear to have been precipitated by the

  abstract  = {The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae
                  Hopkins, is a natural disturbance agent of
                  considerable consequence in western pine
                  forests. This economically and ecologically
                  important insect has a strong requisite for
                  maintaining a strict seasonality. Given this
                  ecological requirement, it is somewhat surprising
                  that no evidence for diapause or other physiological
                  tinting mechanism has been found. Seasonality and
                  phenological timing for this species are apparently
                  under direct temperature control. We investigate the
                  consequences of direct temperature control by first
                  constructing a computationally efficient phenology
                  model based on previously published temperature
                  dependent developmental data. We explored the
                  dynamic properties of this model when subjected to
                  observed microhabitat temperatures representing a
                  range of thermal habitats from one region of the
                  mountain pine beetle distribution. We also
                  investigated the consequences of global climate
                  change on phenology and seasonality. Our results
                  indicate that an adaptive seasonality is a natural
                  consequence of the interaction between developmental
                  parameters and seasonal temperatures. Although this
                  adaptive phenology appears to be resilient to
                  temperature fluctuations, changes in climate within
                  the magnitude of predicted climate change under a
                  CO2 doubling scenario are capable of shifting a
                  thermally hostile environment to a thermally benign
                  environment. Similarly, increasing temperature by
                  the same amount resulted in phenological disruption
                  of a previously favorable thermal habitat. We
                  discuss the implications of these results for
                  restricting the current distribution of mountain
                  pine beetle, and the potential for shifting
                  distribution caused by global climate change.},

                  fire. Mixed forests of ponderosa pine (Pinus

                  today. Fire exclusion over the last 100 years is
                  believed to have caused a shift in forest structure,
                  forest floor decomposition and nitrogen
                  availability. However, no research has clearly
                  demonstrated this in forests of the dry inland
                  northwest. The objective of this study was to
                  determine how fire exclusion has shaped forest
                  structure and understory composition in ponderosa
                  pine/Douglas-fir forests and how these changes have

                  horizon depth and biochemistry were analyzed along a
                  132-year chronosequence at 25 sites in second growth
                  forests of western Montana. Principle components
                  analysis confirmed that time since fire was
                  significantly correlated to most biotic variables,
                  including nutrient availability and indicates that
                  the disturbance regime is tightly coupled to
                  ecosystem function. Douglas-fir basal area, total
                  shrubs and forest floor thickness were observed to
                  increase with time since fire. Graminoids and forbs
                  did not change significantly with time since
                  fire. There was a significant increase in the
                  content of total C, total N, NH4+ and potential
                  mineralizable N (PMN) in the forest floor, while
                  NO3- content decreased significantly with time since
                  fire. Total phenols increased significantly and were
                  positively correlated with forest floor thickness,
                  total shrub cover, PN414 and NH4+, but not
                  correlated with NO3- content, suggesting that
                  phenolic compounds accumulate with time and may
                  affect N transformations. (C) 2004 Elsevier BX All

     two most common pests, mistletoe, Phoradendron pauciflorum Torrey,
     and the fir engraver, Scolytus ventralis LeConte, of white fir (Abies
     concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl.) across a 25-ha grid to assess
     spread and what host and pest variables were related. In these open
     parklike stands the mean tree density was 160 trees/ha, of which 58%
     were trees >20 cm diameter at breast height (DBH). In these
     low-density, mixed-aged stands we found that mixed-conifer species
     were well represented with no one species being completely dominant.
     Percent cumulative mortality for the SSPM was 12.7%, ranging from 2
     to 24%, with the greatest amount of mortality occurring in the larger
     size classes, trees greater than or equal to50 cm DBH. Multiple
     linear regression analysis showed that 78% of the mortality we
     observed was explained by pathogens and bark beetles (r(2) = 0.78, P
     = 0.0001, F = 84). Mean pest incidence for Jeffrey pine (Pinus
     jeffreyi Grev. & Balf. in A. Murray), white fir, and sugar pine
     (Pinus lambertiana Dougl.) was 21, 88, and 2%, respectively. We found
     a number of relationships among host and pest variables, as well as a
     pathogen- insect interaction, and across the SSPM we found that
     nonhost species may be interfering in certain host-pest interactions.
     Spatial patterns from the 25-ha grid survey revealed that both P.
     pauciflorum and S. ventralis incidence were widespread. Phoradendron
     pauciflorum showed no spatial structure across the 25 ha but S.
     ventralis showed some degree of spatial structuring across the survey
     area. We also found that mistletoe severity was negatively correlated
     with regeneration of white fir. In pristine forests, pathogens and
     insects influence mortality and regeneration success, affecting stand
     structure and composition.},

  abstract  = {Fuel reduction by mechanical thinning and removal was studied
     in mixed-conifer stands in northeastern Oregon between 1995 and 1997.
     A single-grip harvester was coupled with either a forwarder or a
     skyline yarding system, and operational economics, fuel reduction,
     stand damage, soil disturbance, effects on soil biota and down-woody
     material were measured in three replicates of paired stands. After
     logging with the harvester, the two log-extraction systems achieved
     nearly equivalent fuel reduction with 45.7 and 46.8% mass reduction
     by the forwarder and skyline system, respectively. Fine-woody fuel
     increased slightly in all units, but mass of heavy fuels decreased.
     Most mass reduction in the forest floor occurred in the duff layer
     with 56 and 49% reduction in forwarder and skyline units,
     respectively. Reduction in stem density and basal area were similar
     for the two extraction systems; in forwarder units stem density was
     reduced by 61.6% and basal area by 55.4%, while in skyline units stem
     density was reduced by 66.5% and basal area by 51.1%. Of seedlings
     and trees examined, 32% had noticeable damage after harvest. Damage
     included bole wounding (38.9% of damaged stems), bark scraping
     (35.0%), wrenched stems (28.9%), broken branches (26.5%), broken
     terminal leaders (15.4%), and crushed foliage (4.1%). More damage
     occurred to residual large trees than to seedlings. Both
     log-extraction systems met the silvicultural prescription of reducing
     fuel and protecting residual large-diameter western larch, Engelmann
     spruce, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine. While fuel, stem, and basal
     area reduction lowered fire risk from a model 10 to a model 8 in all
     stands, large-woody material for wildlife also changed. Mean log
     length was lower in harvested units relative to unharvested controls,
     but this did not decrease occupation of logs by ants or the
     activities of woodpeckers feeding on them. Of 37 logged hectares,
     1.4% (0.5 ha) of the soil area was compacted, mostly in forwarder
     units, within landings, and within trails close to landings. The
     percent area with displaced soil varied from 5 to 43% among units and
     was located within trails or in intertrail areas between the trails.
     Light displacement of soil resulted in a short-term increase in the
     abundance of soil microarthropods. The effects of compaction on
     litter microarthropods was more persistent, with lower numbers in
     compacted litter a year after harvest. While revenue was similar for
     forwarder and skyline units ($68 vs. $70/metric ton, respectively),
     total operational costs were $81/metric ton in the skyline units,
     compared to $46/metric ton in the forwarder units. These results are
     discussed in the context of options available to managers for
     balancing fuel reduction needs with both environmental and economic
     constraints.},

                  evaluated in fire-adapted ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir
                  forests in northeastern Oregon. Treatments included:
                  no management (control), prescribed fall burning
                  (bum), low thinning (thin), and low thinning
                  followed by prescribed fall burning (thin/burn),
                  replicated four times in a completely randomized
                  design. Treatment effects were observed in the first
                  growing season after burning and three seasons after
                  thinning. Species richness of the understory
                  vegetation was significantly lower in the thin than
                  in the control, but Shannon-Weaver's index of
                  diversity was not affected by fuel reduction
                  treatments. Graminoid cover was not influenced by
                  treatment, forb cover was reduced in treatments that
                  included thinning, and shrub and total cover were
                  reduced in treatments that included
                  burning. Individual species responded to treatment
                  in a manner consistent with their life history
                  characteristics. Prairie Junegrass cover increased
                  in those treatments that included burning, while
                  cover of other graminoid species was not
                  significantly influenced. The thin treatment
                  significantly lowered elk sedge and total cover, but
                  did not strongly influence the cover of other
                  species. Prairie Junegrass frequency increased
                  significantly in the burned treatments, while
                  western needlegrass frequency was significantly
                  reduced. Frequency of other species tended to remain
                  the same in all treatments. Resilience of community
                  diversity to fire and the consistent effect of
                  burning on individual species demonstrate their
                  adaptation to frequent low-intensity fire, and the
                  subsequent moderate impact of low thinning and fall
                  prescribed burning on understory vegetation.},

     colonized in this stand increased significantly as the outbreak
     gained momentum, but only as long as the food supply (trees with dbh
     greater-than-or-equal-to 23 cm) was abundant. It also showed that the
     pattern of selection of large and small trees did not change

     suggested that big trees were important to outbreaks beyond simply

     ecosystem's reference conditions (or natural range of variability);
     the difference between reference conditions and contemporary
     conditions is used to assess the need for restorative treatments and
     to evaluate their success. Since ecosystems are highly complex and
     dynamic, it is not possible to describe comprehensively all possible

     characteristics with essential roles in the evolutionary environment
     are chosen for detailed study. Key characteristics of structure,

     ecosystems-are quantified as far as possible through dendroecological
     and paleoecological studies, historical evidence, and comparison to
     undisrupted sites. Ecological restoration treatments are designed to
     reverse recent, human-caused ecological degradation. Testing of
     restoration treatments at four sites in northern Arizona, USA, has

     as "blackjack" ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa <150 years) and 13.3 (s =
     11.9) "yellow pine" (P. ponderosa = 150 years) in 1909-1913. In
     1997-1999, 416 live trees (s 229.6) were "blackjack" and 57.2 (s =
     28.5) trees on average were "yellow pine." Twelve of the 15 plots
     were not invaded by other tree species (remained pure ponderosa pine
     type), while composition shifted slightly on three plots toward more
     shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant species. Ninety-one percent of the
     historically (1909-1913 or older) mapped tree structures (live trees,
     snags, logs, stumps, etc.) were relocated, which suggested that the
     forest reconstruction field techniques are reliable within 10%.
     Dramatic increases in tree densities may represent an increased
     potential for bark beetle epidemics and stand replacing wildfire over
     large areas in the Southwest.},

     to 1992 likely contributed to the mortality increase in the Log Creek
     watershed. The high mortality in the Tharp's Creek watershed was
     primarily related to crown scorch from the 1990 fire and was modeled
     with logistic regression for white fir (Abies concolor [Gord. and
     Glend.]) and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana [Dougl.]). From 1989 to

     (2) two-layer solar treatment with plastic sheeting; and (3)
     two-layer solar treatment without plastic sheeting. For experiment 2,
     two additional one-layer treatments were added: one-layer treatment
     with plastic sheeting and no rotation and a one-layer with no plastic
     sheeting and no rotation. Experiment 3 included all the
     above-mentioned one-layer treatments only. For all experiments, brood
     density per 0.05 m(2) (0.5 ft(2)) was estimated before and after
     treatment and analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance,
     Subcortical temperatures were monitored in one replicate of all
     treatments in all experiments. In experiment 2, phloem moisture was
     monitored before and after treatment in uninfested logs. All
     treatments in all experiments caused drastic reductions in brood
     survival. In experiment 1, the one-layer treatment with the logs
     rotated once a week significantly reduced brood survival compared to
     the two-layer without plastic sheeting treatment but was not
     different from the two-layer with plastic sheeting treatment. There
     were no differences in brood survival after treatment associated with
     any treatments in experiments 2 and 3. In all experiments brood
     survival was consistently reduced in the aspects of the logs exposed
     to the sun. Maximum temperatures were consistently higher in the
     treatments with plastic sheeting, the exposed surfaces of the logs to
     the sun, and the upper layer of logs in the two-layer treatments. No
     differences were detected in phloem moisture content in uninfested
     logs before and after treatment in experiment 2, suggesting that heat
     is directly responsible for the observed reductions in survival. We
     conclude that solar treatments are an effective alternative for
     reducing mountain pine beetle survival in infested ponderosa and
     lodgepole pine logs.},

     southwestern Oregon supports globally outstanding temperate
     biodiversity. Fire has been important in the evolutionary history
     that shaped this diversity, but recent human influences have altered
     the fire environment. We tested for modern human impacts on the fire
     regime by analyzing temporal patterns in fire extent and spatial
     patterns of fire severity in relation to vegetation structure, past
     fire occurrence, roads, and timber management in a 98,814-ha area
     burned in 1987. Fire severity was mapped by the US. Department of
     Agriculture Forest Service as low, moderate, and high based on levels
     of canopy scorch and consumption. We found (1) a trend of increasing
     fire size in recent decades; (2) that overall fire-severity
     proportions were 59% low, 29% moderate, and 12% high, which is
     comparable to both contemporary and historic fires in the region; (3)
     that multiaged, closed forests, the predominant vegetation, burned
     with much lower severity than did open forest and shrubby nonforest
     vegetation; (4) that considerably less high-severity fire occurred
     where fire bad previously be absent since 1920 in closed forests
     compared to where the forests had burned since 1920 (7% vs. 16%); (5)
     that nonforest vegetation burned with greater severity where there
     was a history of fire since 1920 and in roaded areas; and (6) that
     tree plantations experienced twice as much severe fire as multi-aged
     forests. We concluded that fuel buildup in the absence of fire did
     not cause increased fire severity as hypothesized. Instead, fuel that
     is receptive to combustion may decrease in the long absence of fire
     in the closed forests of our study area, which will favor the fire
     regime that has maintained these forests. However, plantations are
     now found in one-third of the roaded landscape. Together with warming
     climate, this may increase the size and severity of future fires,
     favoring further establishment of structurally and biologically
     simple plantations.},

     Forest, mean mortality was 35% in natural stands and 43% in
     plantations two growing seasons after a June 1998 wildfire. Burn
     history significantly affected mortality with those stands
     prescribe-burned 1.5 yr prior to the wildfire having the lowest
     mortality, while stands prescribe-burned 2 or more years prior had
     higher mortality. Although significant tree mortality did occur on
     the Osceola National Forest, with all trees killed in some stands,
     many trees in other burned stands did survive. The overall mortality
     was lower in both plantations and natural stands on the Osceola than
     at Tiger Bay where prescribed burning had been less frequent. The
     highest mortality rates occurred on the Lake Butler Forest where
     prescribed burning had not been used since plantation establishment.
     Thus, a regular prescribed burning program will reduce mortality
     following wildfires in both natural and planted stands of southern
     pines on flat woods sites, even when wildfires occur under severe
     drought conditions.},

                  understory. Although leaf area is often assumed to
                  be correlated with the amount of light penetrating
                  the canopy, this is not the case in tall, old-growth
                  forests. The semivariance of the horizontal
                  distribution of canopy volume was strongly
                  correlated with shrub cover and understory light
                  levels and was an overall predictor of canopy
                  structure. This variability gives rise to
                  potentially higher understory light levels and shrub
                  cover values when compared with a forest lacking
                  this vertical heterogeneity and may allow the stand
                  to support a higher volume of foliage.},

     guide a study of the association between the occurrence of
     beetle-killed trees and factors that might render trees more
     susceptible to attack. Longterm records of beetle kill showed that
     beetle epidemics were associated with windstorms and drought at
     statewide and local spatial scales. At the landscape scale, beetle
     kill was associated with (i) portions of the landscape that were
     potentially drier (southern aspects, lower elevations) and (ii)
     portions of the landscape that had more mature and old-growth conifer
     vegetation. The patches of beetle-killed trees were aggregated with
     respect to other patches at scales of approximately 1 and 4 km. At
     the scale of the individual tree, there was not a strong relationship
     between beetle kill and resistance to attack measured by tree growth
     rate prior to attack. Our results show that landscape-scale phenomena
     and temporal patterns were more strongly correlated with beetle-kill
     events than was recent growth history at the scale of individual
     trees. We suggest that the multi-scale approach we employed is useful
     for elucidating the relative roles of fine- versus coarse-scale
     constraints on ecological processes.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes an improved statistical methodology for
     estimating historical forest fire frequencies from time-since-fire
     map data. Of particular interest is the question of estimating fire
     frequency in temporally distinct epochs. Unlike previous graphical
     and ad hoc methods, the new methodology is firmly grounded within the
     established statistical paradigm of likelihood inference. In
     addition, in contrast to earlier methods, it takes into account the
     fact that surviving stands which originated in earlier epochs, have
     been subject to different hazards of burning as they have lived
     through more recent epochs. Neglecting this fact leads to
     overestimates of the fire frequency in the more recent epochs.
     Procedures for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood
     ratio confidence intervals for the fire frequency in each epoch are
     developed, along with a likelihood ratio test to assess whether the
     fire frequencies in distinct epochs were significantly different.
     This test is not strictly valid when the change points separating
     epochs are suggested from exploratory data analysis; rather it is
     developed assuming that change points are determined independently of
     the data. This distinction, which is necessary to avoid selection
     bias, has not been noted before. The fact that forest fire is a
     contagious process, with consequent spatial autocorrelation in
     time-since-fire observations, is taken into account through the use
     of an overdispersed model, with associated quasi-likelihood function.
     This aspect has been ignored, by and large, in previous analyses
     which have implicitly assumed independence of observations. An
     example is given in which the method is applied to published fire
     history data from the Kananaskis Valley. The results indicate that
     the previous analysis overestimated the fire frequency for the most
     recent epoch. The conclusions of other studies concerning temporal
     changes in fire frequency may need to be reconsidered.},

     controversial. Surprisingly, existing data are inadequate to allow a
     comprehensive evaluation of logging effects on biodiversity,
     composition, and productivity since appropriate comparisons of stands
     of similar ages and differing disturbance histories are rare. We
     addressed this issue using a study of 2000 plots in 80 southern
     boreal forest stands in northern Minnesota, USA, wherein we
     contrasted naturally regenerated aspen (Populus tremuloides), jack
     pine (Pinus banksiana), and black spruce (Picea mariana) stands
     established following logging or the dominant natural disturbance,
     wildfire, for stands of two age classes (25-40 and 70-100 yr old).
     For young stands, those established postlogging had higher vascular
     plant diversity than those postwildfire. Otherwise, we found no
     evidence of differing species diversity (including canopy tree,
     shrub, herbaceous, and bryophyte species), composition, productivity,
     or nitrogen cycling, in forest stands of comparable age and forest
     type that originated after logging compared to after wildfire. These
     variables, however, differed significantly among forest types, with
     aboveground net primary productivity and plant species diversity
     generally higher in aspen than jack pine stands, even when growing on
     comparable soils, and lowest in black spruce. Although there is
     evidence that logging has increased the proportional landscape
     dominance by aspen, a forest type with higher diversity, nutrient
     cycling, and productivity than other types, our evidence refutes the
     idea that disturbance by logging has diminished stand-scale
     productivity or plant diversity in comparison to the common natural
     disturbance, wildfire.},

     Conventional ground survey methods were used to collect coordinates

     distributed under a range of canopy covers. These points were used to
     check the DTM accuracy. The mean DTM error was 0.22 +/- 0.24 m (mean

  abstract  = {Low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug]. ex.
     Laws.) forests of the northern Rocky Mountains historically
     experienced frequent low-intensity fires that maintained open
     uneven-aged stands. A century of fire exclusion has contributed to
     denser ponderosa pine forests with greater competition for resources,
     higher tree stress and greater risk of insect attack and stand-
     destroying fire. Active management intended to restore a semblance of
     the more sustainable historic stand structure and composition
     includes selective thinning and prescribed fire. However, little is
     known about the relative effects of these management practices on the
     physiological performance of ponderosa pine. We measured soil water
     and nitrogen availability, physiological performance and wood radial
     increment of second growth ponderosa pine trees at the Lick Creek
     Experimental Site in the Bitterroot National Forest, Montana, 8 and 9
     years after the application of four treatments: thinning only;
     thinning followed by prescribed fire in the spring: thinning followed
     by prescribed fire in the fall; and untreated controls. Volumetric
     soil water content and resin capsule ammonium did not differ among
     treatments. Resin capsule nitrate in the control treatment was
     similar to that in all other treatments, although burned treatments
     had lower nitrate relative to the thinned-only treatment. Trees of
     similar size and canopy condition in the three thinned treatments
     (with and without fire) displayed higher leaf-area-based
     photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and mid-morning leaf water
     potential in June and July, and higher wood radial increment relative
     to trees in control units. Specific leaf area, mass-based leaf
     nitrogen content and carbon isotope discrimination did not vary among
     treatments. Our results suggest that, despite minimal differences in
     soil resource availability, trees in managed units where basal area
     was reduced had improved gas exchange and growth compared with trees
     in unmanaged units. Prescribed fire (either in the spring or in the
     fall) in addition to thinning, had no measurable effect on the
     mid-term physiological performance and wood growth of second growth
     ponderosa pine.},

     tree water, carbon, and nitrogen relations, or compared effects
     between postsettlement (trees established after Euro-American
     settlement) and presettlement (established before Euro-American

     postsettlement trees to three levels of thinning and burning
     (unthinned/unburned control, light thinning/burning, heavy
     thinning/burning) over 2 yr that differed in precipitation in
     northern Arizona. Both thinning treatments consistently increased
     predawn water potential of both tree sizes compared with the control.
     Effects of thinning on leaf gas exchange varied between tree sizes
     and measurement times. Thinning increased net photosynthetic rate and
     stomatal conductance only when soil water availability was lowest,
     and increases were greater for postsettlement than presettlement
     trees. In contrast, thinning had no effect on foliar nitrogen
     concentration. \ Our results suggest greater positive effects of
     restoration thinning on tree water and carbon relations for
     postsettlement versus presettlement trees, and under drought versus
     nondrought conditions. Photosynthetic response to thinning in old
     trees may be constrained by physiological factors associated with
     large size such as low soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance.},

     in northern Arizona stands subjected to four levels of thinning.
     Thinning treatments varied the number of postsettlement trees
     retained to replace dead presettlement trees. Thinning increased
     radial growth at breast height of postsettlement trees in all 3 years
     after treatment, and growth response was negatively correlated with
     posttreatment stand basal area. In contrast, growth of presettlement
     trees was not affected by thinning in most years, and there was no
     relationship between growth and posttreatment stand basal area.
     Application of the same thinning prescription to stands with
     different management history resulted in different posttreatment
     basal area and consequently different growth response to thinning for
     postsettlement trees. Our results show that growth of 80-year-old,
     postsettlement ponderosa pines is more responsive to restoration
     thinning than older presettlement trees, and provide guidelines for
     thinning levels needed to stimulate growth of presettlement trees.},

     ownership and fifth level watersheds. We also analyzed changes in
     forest patterns by land ownership for three major river basins within
     the ecoregion (Eel, Klamath, and Rogue) using FRAGSTATS. Overall,
     forests covered 66.8% of the ecoregion in 1972 and 62.1% in 1992.
     Approximately 10.5% of the forest area was disturbed overall,
     translating into an annual disturbance rate of 0.53%. Although public
     lands accounted for a slightly higher total area of forest
     disturbance, private lands were cut at a slightly higher rate. Forest
     disturbance within fifth level watersheds averaged 13.2%, but reached
     as high as 93.2%. For the three river basins where spatial pattern of
     forest disturbance was analyzed, private lands were already more
     fragmented than public lands in 1972. Over the 20-year time period,
     forest fragmentation increased on all ownerships. Fragmentation rates
     on public lands were high for all basins especially the Rogue.
     Clearcut logging on private lands was generally in larger adjacent
     tracts, whereas cuts on public lands were generally smaller and more
     dispersed. Our results illustrate the importance of considering
     landscape change history when planning for effective biodiversity
     conservation in forested ecoregions and when formulating ecologically
     sustainable forest management strategies.},

  abstract  = {Forest-fire policy of U.S. federal agencies has evolved from
     the use of small patrols in newly created National Parks to diverse
     policy initiatives and institutional arrangements that affect
     millions of hectares of forests. Even with large expenditures and
     substantial infrastructure dedicated to fire suppression, the annual
     area burned by wildfire has increased over the last decade. Given the
     current and future challenges of fire management, and based on
     analytical research and review of existing policies and their
     implications, we believe several changes and re-emphases in existing
     policy are warranted. Most importantly, the actual goal of
     fuels-management projects should be the reduction of potential fire
     behavior and effects, not the simple. reduction of fuels. To improve
     safety and economic efficiency, fire-suppression policies should
     recognize differences in the characteristics of wildfires, and
     strategies should be tailored to better respond to the unique demands
     of each fire. Where forest fires are burning large areas, as in the
     western United States, reducing the trend of increased amounts of
     burned area may require a diversity of treatments, including
     prescribed burning, mechanical fuels treatment, and increased use of
     the Wildland Fire Use Policy. Assessment of how fire is affecting
     forests would be enhanced if land-management agencies reported the
     area burned by low-, mixed-, and high-severity fire and what
     proportion is outside the desired trend or range of conditions for
     each forest type. Congress should provide an improved budgetary
     process for fire and fuels management, with a larger annual federal
     fire-suppression budget. Additionally, reducing annual area burned
     will require long-term coordinated efforts by federal and state
     governments, with robust partnerships between land-management
     agencies and the public in collaborative planning and stewardship.
     Research and adaptive management are essential in allowing
     fire-hazard-reduction projects to move forward where proposed
     projects are met with uncertainty and mistrust. While legislative
     reform may be desirable, a strategy that is not entirely dependent on
     new legislation is needed. Building on existing programs that are
     consistent with a science-based strategy will enable land-management
     agencies to better utilize information in pursuit of the overall
     objective of reducing uncharacteristically severe wildfires.},

                  correlated significantly with the severity of the
                  bums and amounted to 5% of stems in the hottest bum
                  treatment after 3 years. The majority of the
                  mortality was observed in the second and third years
                  post-bum. Attacks of Ips and Dendroctonus bark
                  beetles were apparent on nearly all dead or dying
                  trees, and evidence suggested that root pathogens
                  may have contributed to tree susceptibility to
                  beetle attack and mortality. Our data indicate that
                  selection of bum regimes that reduce or eliminate
                  consumption of duff (e.g., favoring heading fires
                  over backing fires) could significantly reduce
                  mortality of longleaf pine managed for long
                  rotations. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

                  patterns of aboveground net primary production
                  (ANPP) and leaf area index (LAI) were examined in
                  ninety 11-year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta
                  var. latifolia Engelm.) stands across the landscape
                  of Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming,
                  USA. Field studies and aerial photography were used
                  to address three questions: (1) What is the range
                  and spatial pattern of lodgepole pine sapling
                  density across the burned Yellowstone landscape and
                  what factors best explain this variability? (2) How
                  do ANPP and LAI vary across the landscape and is
                  their variation explained by abiotic factors,
                  sapling density, or both? (3) What is the predicted
                  spatial pattern of ANPP and LAI across the burned
                  Yellowstone landscape? Stand density spanned six
                  orders of magnitude, ranging from zero to 535,000
                  saplings ha(-1), and it decreased with increasing
                  elevation and with increasing distance from unburned
                  forest (r(2) = 0.37). Postfire densities mapped from
                  1:30,000 aerial photography revealed that 66% of the
                  burned area had densities less than 5000 saplings
                  ha(-1) and approximately 25% had densities greater
                  than 10,000 saplings ha(-1); stand density varied
                  spatially in a fine-grained mosaic. New allometric
                  equations were developed to predict aboveground
                  biomass, ANPP, and LAI of lodgepole pine saplings
                  and the 25 most common herbaceous and shrub species
                  in the burned forests. These allometrics were then
                  used with field data on sapling size, sapling
                  density, and percent cover of graminoid, forb, and
                  shrub species to compute stand-level ANPP and
                  LAI. Total ANPP averaged 2.8 Mg ha(-1) y(-3) but
                  ranged from 0.04 to 15.12 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). Total LAI
                  averaged 0.80 m(2) m(-2) and ranged from 0.01 to
                  6.87 m(2) m(-2). Variation in ANPP and LAI was
                  explained by both sapling density and abiotic
                  factors (elevation and soil class) (ANOVA, r(2) =
                  0.80); abiotic variables explained 51%-54% of this
                  variation. The proportion of total ANPP contributed
                  by herbaceous plants and shrubs declined sharply
                  with increasing sapling density (r(2) = 0.72) and
                  increased with elevation (r(2) = 0.36). However,
                  total herbaceous productivity was always less than
                  2.7 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and herbaceous productivity did
                  not compensate for tree production when trees were
                  sparse. When extrapolated to the landscape, 68% of
                  the burned landscape was characterized by ANPP
                  values less than 2.0 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), 22% by values
                  ranging from 2 to 4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and the
                  remaining 10% by values greater than 4 Mg ha(-1)
                  y(-1). The spatial patterns of ANPP and LAI were
                  less heterogeneous than patterns of sapling density
                  but still showed fine-grained variation in
                  rates. For some ecosystem processes, postfire
                  spatial heterogeneity within a successional stage
                  may be similar in magnitude to the temporal
                  variation observed through succession.},

     (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) susceptibility. Crown scorch of 40 Pinus
     ponderosa trees was estimated in a naturally regenerated stand that
     was thinned and prescribed burned in winter and early spring 2000.
     Net photosynthetic rate (P-n) of undamaged foliage was higher in
     heavily and severely than moderately and lightly scorched trees. This
     trend was more pronounced in the dry season (June) than the wet
     season (August). This suggests the mechanism underlying the increase
     in P-n was an improvement in water relations. This was also supported
     by differences observed in predawn water potential and stomatal
     conductance (g(s)). Constitutive resin volume did not differ among
     crown scorch classes in June, but was negatively related to crown
     scorch intensity in September. This suggests that constitutive resin
     was formed and stored before fire injury, and therefore not strongly
     affected by crown scorch levels in June. Induced resin production
     (resin produced after depletion of constitutive resin) generally
     decreased with increasing crown scorch in both June and September.
     Induced resin appeared to be related to carbon available for resin
     synthesis. The proportion of successful colonization attempts by Ips
     spp. and Dendroctonus spp. was low throughout the season.
     Colonization of Ips sp. and Dendroctonus spp. was not spatially
     separated in host trees. Colonization attempts were generally
     positively related to intensity of crown scorch in both pheromone and
     no-pheromone treatments. This finding suggests that pheromones
     attracted insects to the tree, but host physiological condition or
     other factors ultimately determined host colonization. Our results
     also suggest that intensity of crown scorch may affect colonization
     attempts of Ips and Dendroctonus spp. on P. ponderosa trees.},

                  Choristoneura pinus pinus, the jack pine budworm, on
                  Pinus banksiana Lamb., jack pine. We quantified a
                  range of defoliation by C. pinus pinus in test trees
                  and measured parameters of host defenses and
                  colonization by bark beetles (Coleoptera:
                  Scolytidae) and woodborers (Coleoptera:
                  Cerambycidae). We also measured colonization and
                  accompanying tree mortality attributable to these
                  insects. Tree physiological parameters and insect
                  colonization patterns were measured over a 24-mo
                  period. Primary resin flow rates and the ability of
                  active responses to confine the bark beetle's fungal
                  symbiont Ophiostoma ips within the phloem, were
                  reduced by high levels of defoliation. These
                  patterns were further influenced by host seasonal
                  phenology and time since defoliation. The
                  predominant subcortical insects responding to
                  defoliation by C. pinus pinus were Ips grandicollis
                  and Monochamus carolinensis. Colonization by these
                  insects together increased exponentially in relation
                  to defoliation level, but the two species
                  differentially exploited trees from particular
                  defoliation levels. The loss of growth among
                  surviving trees increased with defoliation
                  intensity. However, growth and defensive capacity
                  were not related, either negatively or positively,
                  during any interval of this study. Depending on the
                  length of time since defoliation stress, the
                  relationship between plant defense and defoliation
                  intensity uas either parabolic, as predicted by
                  growth differentiation theory, or inverse linear, as
                  predicted by plant stress theory. Thus, differing
                  models depicting how carbon allocation and overall
                  carbon availability can influence secondary-chemical
                  metabolism in plants may represent various stages
                  along a temporal continuum. Our results suggest that
                  the time since a stress is exerted is an important
                  variant that should be incorporated into synthetic
                  theories of plant defense. These results also
                  suggest that integrative models of plant defense
                  theory can be extended to describe impacts on
                  community-level interactions.},

                  conducted to determine whether responses by
                  individual beetles to monoterpenes are altered by
                  pheromones and/or the presence of other
                  beetles. 2. Entry into the amended media by Ips pini
                  and the length of time until entry were not
                  influenced by the presence of aggregation

                  on host entry behaviour were mediated by the density
                  of beetles on the surface of the assay arena, and by
                  the density of beetles constructing galleries within
                  the medium. 4. The percentage of beetles entering
                  medium amended with higher concentrations of
                  monoterpenes increased with increased density of
                  beetles on the surface of the assay arena, until a
                  threshold density of three or four beetles per assay
                  arena, after which entrance rate declined. 5. The
                  presence of other beetles constructing galleries
                  elicited more rapid entry by the test
                  beetles. 6. Gallery lengths were generally higher in
                  the presence of aggregation pheromones. 7. Gallery
                  lengths increased with increased density of beetles

                  conducted field and laboratory experiments on spruce
                  beetles from 29 endemic and eruptive populations in
                  Alaska and Utah, USA, and Yukon, Canada. Beetles
                  from both population phases colonized trees that had
                  been felled to remove host defenses. However, only
                  beetles from eruptive populations colonized
                  defended, healthy trees. A series of laboratory
                  assays using host-based media amended with varying
                  concentrations of phytochemicals identified several
                  factors affecting population-dependent responses to
                  hosts. First, beetles were repelled by high
                  concentrations of the predominant spruce
                  monoterpene, alpha-pinene, but intermediate
                  concentrations elicited entry and gallery
                  construction. Second, heritability assays suggested
                  high genetic variance of host selection behavior
                  within populations, and between-population
                  differences persisted following rearing in a common
                  environment. Third, beetles from eruptive
                  populations were less likely to enter medium amended
                  with phytochemicals and constructed shorter
                  galleries, which disagreed with our prediction and
                  seemingly contradicted the field
                  observations. However, fourth, beetle avoidance of
                  high concentrations of alpha-pinene decreased with
                  the addition of other beetles, and this effect was
                  more pronounced among beetles from eruptive
                  populations than among those from endemic
                  populations. This interaction broadened the host
                  range of eruptive beetles. We propose that such
                  density-dependent behaviors can maintain
                  heterogeneity among population phases and contribute
                  to positive feedback in herbivore population
                  dynamics. A conceptual model suggests how heritable
                  and environmentally induced variation in host
                  selection behavior can affect bimodal equilibria and
                  numerical thresholds in eruptive species.},

     Forest tree density averaged more than 20 times the historical tree
     density, and basal area was 4 to 6 times higher in contemporary
     forests than in historical forests. Restoration treatments consisted
     of thinning young trees to emulate the forest density, tree
     composition, and spatial distribution in 1870, followed by prescribed
     burning. Following restoration treatment, tree density was
     significantly reduced but remained 6 times higher than historical
     forests. Basal area in restored forests was still 2.5 times greater
     than reconstructed basal area values. Ponderosa pine dominance
     changed little from pretreatment data across the four blocks,
     averaging 60% of stems and 87% of the basal area prior to treatment
     and 56% of stems and 85% of the basal area following treatment.
     Ninety-eight percent of contemporary forest trees were less than 100
     yr old prior to restoration treatment;this proportion was reduced to
     82% following treatment. Restoration treatment also significantly
     reduced canopy cover and increased total tree regeneration. However,
     treatment effects on forest fuels were highly variable. Litter and
     duff fuel layers were significantly reduced by prescribed fire but
     woody debris increased. Overall forest structural diversity following
     treatment implies that fire behavior, wildlife habitats, and other
     ecological attributes will vary relatively widely in the future
     landscape. FOR. SCI. 49(6):885-900.},

     contrasting disturbance regimes are not well understood. The
     objectives of this study were to determine the extent to which white
     pine could invade areas recently disturbed by fire or logging (within
     10-28 years), and assess the relative limitations placed on
     recruitment by seed supply, microsite habitat, and competition. We
     compared white pine regeneration on 61 sites disturbed by fire or
     logging that were adjacent to intact mature stands that provided a
     seed source. White pine seedling and sapling densities declined with
     increasing distance from a seed source, and the rate of decrease was
     determined by the interaction between seed supply and variation in
     number and quality of safe sites. For a given combination of seed
     source and site, white pine seedlings were three times more abundant
     on burned than logged sites. White pine seedlings grew into the
     sapling size class more often on burned than logged sites due to
     lower shrub cover on burned sites. At 25 years after disturbance,
     regeneration densities of white pine sufficient to achieve eventual
     future dominance occurred up to 80 m and 20 m from the edge of mature
     white pine stands after fire and logging, respectively. To attain a
     similar level of white pine stocking after disturbance, three to four
     times as many patches of mature white pine need to be left after
     logging than after fire.},

  abstract  = {Pinus ponderosa Laws. (ponderosa pine) forests have changed
     considerably during the past century, partly because recurrent fires
     have been absent for a century or more. A number of studies have
     explored the influence of timber harvest or burning on understory
     production in ponderosa pine forests, but study designs incorporating
     cutting and prescribed burning in an experimental framework are
     needed to identify mechanisms responsible for the observed changes.
     In this study, we first characterized the disturbance history and the
     soil seed bank of a ponderosa pine stand in the northern Black Hills.
     We then experimentally addressed the effects of prescribed burning
     and overstory reduction on understory vegetation. Before Anglo
     settlement of the area, the mean fire interval was 14 years and no
     fires were recorded after 1879. Cessation of fires, prolific
     regeneration of ponderosa pine, and subsequent logging in 1903 has
     led to a very dense, even-aged ponderosa pine stand with very little
     understory vegetation and very few viable seeds in the soil seed
     bank. Only 57 individual plants, or 186 seeds/m(2), emerged from 1080
     soil samples. Response of understory vegetation during the first
     growing season after application of treatments was sparse, with no
     significant treatment effect. There were, however, significant
     treatment effects during the second growing season. Total understory
     biomass ranged from 5.8 kg/ha on untreated plots to 1724 kg/ha on
     clearcut, unburned plots. Herbaceous dicots comprised over 90% of
     total understory biomass. Both understory species richness and
     evenness responded to treatments, but understory woody plant density
     did not respond to either treatment. Paucity of viable seeds in the
     soil seed bank does not appear to constrain recruitment of understory
     vegetation in dense ponderosa pine forests of South Dakota. (C) 2004

  abstract  = {An introduced pathogen, white pine blister rust (Cronartium
     ribicola), has caused declines in five-needled pines throughout North
     America. Simultaneously, fire exclusion has resulted in dense stands
     in many forest types, which may create additional stress for these
     generally shade-intolerant pines. Fire exclusion also allows fuels to
     accumulate, and it is unclear how affected populations will respond
     to the reintroduction of fire. Although white pine blister rust and
     fire exclusion are widely recognized threats, long-term demographic
     data that document the effects of these stressors are rare. We
     present population trends from 2168 individuals over 5-15 years for
     an affected species, sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), at several
     burned and unburned sites in the Sierra Nevada of California.
     Size-based matrix models indicate that most unburned populations have
     negative growth rates (lambda range: 0.82-1.04). The growth rate of
     most populations was, however, indistinguishable from replacement
     levels (lambda = 1.0), implying that, if populations are indeed
     declining, the progression of any such decline is slow, and longer
     observations are needed to clearly determine population trends. We
     found significant differences among population growth rates,
     primarily due to variation in recruitment rates. Deaths associated
     with blister rust and stress (i.e., resource competition) were
     common, suggesting significant roles for both blister rust and fire
     exclusion in determining population trajectories. Data from 15
     prescribed fires showed that the immediate effect of burning was the
     death of many small trees, with the frequency of mortality returning
     to pre-fire levels within five years. In spite of a poor prognosis
     for sugar pine, our results suggest that we have time to apply and
     refine management strategies to protect this species.},

                  showed that percent ash content, heat content with
                  ash, and heat content without ash of needle and duff
                  fuels significantly varied by species, fuel
                  component, and developmental stage of the
                  overstory. Ash and heat contents of woody fuels
                  varied by species and fuel component but not by
                  developmental stage. Bark fuels significantly
                  differed by species, while no factor significantly
                  affected cone fuels. Regional variation in ash and
                  heat content was evident but small. However, the
                  values reported here for heat content with ash for
                  fine fuels averaged 2.50 MJ kg(-1) higher than the
                  standard values used in fire behavior prediction
                  systems. Using standard values can result in
                  significant under predictions of fireline intensity
                  of an average of 16 percent for all species of up to
                  47 percent for Pinus albicaulis.},
