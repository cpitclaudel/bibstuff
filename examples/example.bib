     mortality, regeneration, floristic richness, fuel load and disease
     incidence in our study area in the Tahoe Basin of California and
     Nevada. The stands are within the lower and upper montane zones
     (1900-2400 in a.s.l.) and they are rare, occupying < 2% of the land
     in the Basin's watershed. Correlation matrices and ANOVAs of forest
     types and conifer species with environmental gradients revealed
     significant relationships with elevation, distance east of the
     Sierran crest, slope aspect, annual precipitation, date of complete
     snow melt, litter depth and degree of soil profile development.
     Pathogens, parasites and wood-boring insects were present on 23% of
     living trees; 16% of all trees were dead. We compared these stands to
     a reconstruction of pre-contact Basin forests and to ecologically
     analogous old-growth forests of Baja California that have never
     experienced fire suppression management. Currently, overstorey trees
     (> 180 yr old) in the Basin stands have ca. 33% cover, 54 m(2).ha(-1)
     basal area and 107 individuals.ha(-1), values very similar to
     reconstructions of pre-contact Basin forests and to modern Baja
     California forests. Understorey trees (60-180 yr old), however, are
     several times more dense than historic levels and species composition
     is strongly dominated by A. concolor, regardless of the overstorey
     composition. The ratio of Pinus : Abies has increased - and the age
     structure of extant stands predicts that it will continue to increase
     - from approximately 1:1 in pre-contact time to 1:7 within the next
     century. Disease incidence and mortality in Baja forests were lower.
     Although we quantitatively defined current Basin old-growth forests -
     in terms of stand structure - we realize that our definition will
     differ from that of both past and future old-growth forests unless
     management protocols are changed.},

                  testing the hypothesis that pre-fire suppression
                  fire regime parameters vary with species composition
                  (tree species), and environment (i.e. slope aspect,
                  slope position, elevation). Location Our study was
                  conducted in the 1587 ha Cub Creek Research Natural
                  Area (CCRNA), Lassen National Forest, CA,
                  USA. Methods We quantified the return interval,
                  seasonal occurrence, size, rotation period, and
                  severity of fires using dendroecology. Results Slope
                  aspect, potential soil moisture, forest composition,
                  and fire regime parameters in our study area
                  co-vary. Median composite and point fire return
                  intervals (FRI) were longest on higher, cooler, more
                  mesic, north-facing (NF) slopes covered with white
                  fir (Abies concolor), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga
                  menziesii)-white fir, and red fir
                  (A. magnifica)-white fir forests, shortest on the
                  dry, south-facing (SF) slopes covered with ponderosa
                  pine (Pinus ponderosa)-white fir forests and
                  intermediate on west-facing slopes dominated by
                  white fir-sugar pine (P. lambertiana)-incense cedar
                  (Libocedrus decurrens) forests. The spatial pattern
                  for length of fire rotation (FR) was the same as
                  that for FRI. Fires in CCRNA mixed conifer forests
                  occurred mainly (90%) in the dormant season. Size of
                  burns in CCRNA mixed conifer forests were generally
                  small (mean = 106 ha), however, during certain
                  drought years widespread fires burned across fuel
                  breaks and spread throughout the watershed. Fire
                  severity was mainly high on upper slopes, low on
                  lower slopes and moderate and low severity on middle
                  slopes. Patterns of fire severity also varied with
                  slope aspect. Fire frequency decreased dramatically
                  in CCRNA after 1905. Conclusions In CCRNA, fire
                  regime parameters [e.g. FRI, fire extent, FR, fire
                  severity] varied widely with species composition,
                  slope aspect and slope position. There was also
                  temporal variation in fire extent with the most
                  widespread fires occurring during drought years. The
                  important contributions of topography and climate to
                  variation in the fire regime indicates that
                  exogenous factors play a key role in shaping the
                  fire-forest structure mosaic and that the
                  fire-forest structure mosaic is more variable, less
                  predictable and less stable than previously
                  thought. Finally, some characteristics of the fire
                  regime (i.e. fire severity, season of burn) in CCRNA
                  are different than those described for other mixed
                  conifer forests and this suggests that there are
                  geographical differences in mixed conifer fire
                  regimes along the Pacific slope.},

                  National Park were dendrochronologically cross-dated
                  and used to develop a fire history from 1714 to
                  1985. A master chronology for the study area was
                  first developed from old-growth trees and provided
                  dating control for fire-scarred samples. Redwood
                  offers a challenge for dendrochronology owing to
                  partially absent rings (ring wedging) and uniform
                  ring widths (complacency). Cross dating was
                  successful in portions of 12 of 24 fire-scarred
                  trees. Fire events were dated by noting the position
                  of fire scars and other fire-associated ring
                  structures (resin ducts, double latewood, growth
                  releases, and ring separations) in the cross-dated
                  ring series. Using only dates of fire scars, the
                  mean fire interval (MFI) was 9.9 years from the
                  first recorded fire in 1714 to the last in 1962. The
                  MFI was 8.0 years for the best represented (greatest
                  sample depth) presettlement period from 1714 to
                  1881. Using dates for all fire-associated ring
                  features, the MFI from 1714 to 1962 was 7.0 years
                  and from 1714 to 1881 was 6.0 years. Use of all
                  fire-associated ring characteristics is argued to be
                  a more complete representation of past fire
                  frequency due to possible under-representation of
                  fire-scar records from stump-top samples. Based upon
                  scar positions within annual rings, fires occurred
                  predominately late in the growing season or after
                  growth ceased for the year. The mean fire intervals
                  determined are shorter than those reported in all
                  except one other fire history study from coast
                  redwood and suggest that fire frequency in redwood
                  may have been underestimated in many past studies.},

                  resprout from underground organs after
                  fires. Responses to variation in characteristics of
                  fire regimes may be a function of plant
                  physiological status or fire intensity. Although
                  these hypotheses have been explored for trees in
                  southeastern longleaf pine (Pines palustris)
                  savannas, responses of other life forms and stages
                  have not been studied. We examined effects of fire
                  season and frequency, geography, habitat, and
                  underground organ morphology on resprouting of
                  shrubs. In 1994, we located replicated sites, each
                  containing two habitats, upslope savannas and
                  downslope seepages, in Louisiana and Florida. Each
                  site, which contained quadrats located along
                  transects within a 30 X 60 m plot, was burned either
                  during the dormant or growing season and then
                  reburned similarly two years later. Maximum fire
                  temperatures were measured, and densities of shrub
                  stems were censused in quadrats before and after
                  fires. Shrubs collectively resprouted more following
                  dormant than growing-season fires, regardless of
                  habitat or geographic region. After repeated
                  dormant-season fires, collective densities in
                  seepages of both regions and densities of
                  root-crown-bearing shrubs in Florida seepages were
                  greater than those initially and after repeated
                  growing-season fires. Shrub responses were generally
                  unrelated to fire temperatures, supporting the
                  hypothesis that resprouting of shrubs may be more
                  dependent on their physiological status at the time
                  of fires. There was, nonetheless, an inverse
                  relationship between collective and
                  root-crown-bearing shrub densities following
                  repeated fires and maximum fire temperatures in
                  Florida seepages. Anthropogenic dormant-season fires
                  over many decades may have resulted in increases in
                  shrub densities in longleaf pine savannas,
                  especially seepages. Repeated growing-season fires,
                  however, neither increased nor reduced densities of
                  established shrubs. Long-term shifts in
                  characteristics of fire regimes, even in
                  fire-frequented habitats, may produce effects that
                  are not reversible in the short term (<10 yr) by
                  simply reintroducing prescribed fires that resemble
                  those that occurred naturally during the growing
                  season.},

     beetle-killed trees and factors that might render trees more

     beetle epidemics were associated with windstorms and drought at
     statewide and local spatial scales. At the landscape scale, beetle
     kill was associated with (i) portions of the landscape that were
     potentially drier (southern aspects, lower elevations) and (ii)
     portions of the landscape that had more mature and old-growth conifer
     vegetation. The patches of beetle-killed trees were aggregated with
     respect to other patches at scales of approximately 1 and 4 km. At
     the scale of the individual tree, there was not a strong relationship
     between beetle kill and resistance to attack measured by tree growth
     rate prior to attack. Our results show that landscape-scale phenomena

     Laws.) forests of the northern Rocky Mountains historically
     experienced frequent low-intensity fires that maintained open
     uneven-aged stands. A century of fire exclusion has contributed to
     denser ponderosa pine forests with greater competition for resources,
     higher tree stress and greater risk of insect attack and stand-
     destroying fire. Active management intended to restore a semblance of
     the more sustainable historic stand structure and composition
     includes selective thinning and prescribed fire. However, little is
     known about the relative effects of these management practices on the
     physiological performance of ponderosa pine. We measured soil water
     and nitrogen availability, physiological performance and wood radial
     increment of second growth ponderosa pine trees at the Lick Creek
     Experimental Site in the Bitterroot National Forest, Montana, 8 and 9
     years after the application of four treatments: thinning only;
     thinning followed by prescribed fire in the spring: thinning followed
     by prescribed fire in the fall; and untreated controls. Volumetric
     soil water content and resin capsule ammonium did not differ among
     treatments. Resin capsule nitrate in the control treatment was
     similar to that in all other treatments, although burned treatments
     had lower nitrate relative to the thinned-only treatment. Trees of
     similar size and canopy condition in the three thinned treatments
     (with and without fire) displayed higher leaf-area-based
     photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and mid-morning leaf water
     potential in June and July, and higher wood radial increment relative
     to trees in control units. Specific leaf area, mass-based leaf
     nitrogen content and carbon isotope discrimination did not vary among
     treatments. Our results suggest that, despite minimal differences in
     soil resource availability, trees in managed units where basal area
     was reduced had improved gas exchange and growth compared with trees
     in unmanaged units. Prescribed fire (either in the spring or in the
     fall) in addition to thinning, had no measurable effect on the
     mid-term physiological performance and wood growth of second growth
     ponderosa pine.},

  abstract  = {Forest-fire policy of U.S. federal agencies has evolved from
     the use of small patrols in newly created National Parks to diverse
     policy initiatives and institutional arrangements that affect
     millions of hectares of forests. Even with large expenditures and
     substantial infrastructure dedicated to fire suppression, the annual
     area burned by wildfire has increased over the last decade. Given the
     current and future challenges of fire management, and based on
     analytical research and review of existing policies and their
     implications, we believe several changes and re-emphases in existing
     policy are warranted. Most importantly, the actual goal of
     fuels-management projects should be the reduction of potential fire
     behavior and effects, not the simple. reduction of fuels. To improve
     safety and economic efficiency, fire-suppression policies should
     recognize differences in the characteristics of wildfires, and
     strategies should be tailored to better respond to the unique demands
     of each fire. Where forest fires are burning large areas, as in the
     western United States, reducing the trend of increased amounts of
     burned area may require a diversity of treatments, including
     prescribed burning, mechanical fuels treatment, and increased use of
     the Wildland Fire Use Policy. Assessment of how fire is affecting
     forests would be enhanced if land-management agencies reported the
     area burned by low-, mixed-, and high-severity fire and what
     proportion is outside the desired trend or range of conditions for
     each forest type. Congress should provide an improved budgetary
     process for fire and fuels management, with a larger annual federal
     fire-suppression budget. Additionally, reducing annual area burned
     will require long-term coordinated efforts by federal and state
     governments, with robust partnerships between land-management
     agencies and the public in collaborative planning and stewardship.
     Research and adaptive management are essential in allowing
     fire-hazard-reduction projects to move forward where proposed
     projects are met with uncertainty and mistrust. While legislative
     reform may be desirable, a strategy that is not entirely dependent on
     new legislation is needed. Building on existing programs that are
     consistent with a science-based strategy will enable land-management
     agencies to better utilize information in pursuit of the overall
     objective of reducing uncharacteristically severe wildfires.},

                  attracted to burned plots in numbers that correlated

                  burned sites was greatest in the first weeks
                  post-bum and disappeared by the second year. Two

                  correlated significantly with the severity of the

                  mortality was observed in the second and third years
                  post-bum. Attacks of Ips and Dendroctonus bark
                  beetles were apparent on nearly all dead or dying
                  trees, and evidence suggested that root pathogens
                  may have contributed to tree susceptibility to
                  beetle attack and mortality. Our data indicate that
                  selection of bum regimes that reduce or eliminate
                  consumption of duff (e.g., favoring heading fires
                  over backing fires) could significantly reduce

  abstract  = {An introduced pathogen, white pine blister rust (Cronartium
     ribicola), has caused declines in five-needled pines throughout North
     America. Simultaneously, fire exclusion has resulted in dense stands
     in many forest types, which may create additional stress for these
     generally shade-intolerant pines. Fire exclusion also allows fuels to
     accumulate, and it is unclear how affected populations will respond
     to the reintroduction of fire. Although white pine blister rust and
     fire exclusion are widely recognized threats, long-term demographic
     data that document the effects of these stressors are rare. We
     present population trends from 2168 individuals over 5-15 years for
     an affected species, sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), at several
     burned and unburned sites in the Sierra Nevada of California.
     Size-based matrix models indicate that most unburned populations have
     negative growth rates (lambda range: 0.82-1.04). The growth rate of
     most populations was, however, indistinguishable from replacement
     levels (lambda = 1.0), implying that, if populations are indeed
     declining, the progression of any such decline is slow, and longer
     observations are needed to clearly determine population trends. We
     found significant differences among population growth rates,
     primarily due to variation in recruitment rates. Deaths associated
     with blister rust and stress (i.e., resource competition) were
     common, suggesting significant roles for both blister rust and fire
     exclusion in determining population trajectories. Data from 15
     prescribed fires showed that the immediate effect of burning was the
     death of many small trees, with the frequency of mortality returning
     to pre-fire levels within five years. In spite of a poor prognosis
     for sugar pine, our results suggest that we have time to apply and
     refine management strategies to protect this species.},

     (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) susceptibility. Crown scorch of 40 Pinus
     ponderosa trees was estimated in a naturally regenerated stand that
     was thinned and prescribed burned in winter and early spring 2000.
     Net photosynthetic rate (P-n) of undamaged foliage was higher in
     heavily and severely than moderately and lightly scorched trees. This
     trend was more pronounced in the dry season (June) than the wet
     season (August). This suggests the mechanism underlying the increase
     in P-n was an improvement in water relations. This was also supported
     by differences observed in predawn water potential and stomatal
     conductance (g(s)). Constitutive resin volume did not differ among
     crown scorch classes in June, but was negatively related to crown
     scorch intensity in September. This suggests that constitutive resin
     was formed and stored before fire injury, and therefore not strongly
     affected by crown scorch levels in June. Induced resin production
     (resin produced after depletion of constitutive resin) generally
     decreased with increasing crown scorch in both June and September.
     Induced resin appeared to be related to carbon available for resin
     synthesis. The proportion of successful colonization attempts by Ips
     spp. and Dendroctonus spp. was low throughout the season.
     Colonization of Ips sp. and Dendroctonus spp. was not spatially
     separated in host trees. Colonization attempts were generally
     positively related to intensity of crown scorch in both pheromone and
     no-pheromone treatments. This finding suggests that pheromones
     attracted insects to the tree, but host physiological condition or
     other factors ultimately determined host colonization. Our results
     also suggest that intensity of crown scorch may affect colonization
     attempts of Ips and Dendroctonus spp. on P. ponderosa trees.},
