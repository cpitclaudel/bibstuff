Introduction
------------------

The maintenance of diversity stands as one of the great theoretical
challenges of ecology. The principle of competitive exclusion states
that two ecologically identical species cannot coexist indefinitely.
Niche theory provided the first solution to the coexistence problem,
based on the differentiation in resource use among co-existing
species and associated reduction in the intensity of interspecific
competition [MacArthur+Levins:1967, MacArthur:1970, Tilman:1980]_ .
 A variety of other models have been proposed that lead
to maintenance of diversity, such as competition-colonization
trade-offs, storage effects, and chaotic oscillations
A critical feature shared by all of these
models is that the mechanisms of coexistence are based on differences
in demographic or ecological attributes of the species, so they
explicitly predict the maintenance of functional diversity (i.e.,
differences in resource use or niche parameters) in parallel with
species diversity.

In contrast, non niche-based models of diversity have
examined the role of stochastic dynamics and intrinsic
frequency-dependence, in the absence of explicit differences in
species' ecological parameters. Island biogeography theory was an
early example of a non niche-based theory.
Most recently, [Hubbell:2001]_ has introduced a neutral or
symmetric model of diversity based on stochastic demographic dynamics
in a large meta-community landscape. In Hubbell's model, speciation
in the regional species pool counteracts random demographic
extinctions, and migration between communities maintains diversity in
the face of random local extirpation [Mutch:1970]_. The neutrality assumption is
that all species are demographically identical, and therefore species
diversity is maintained without any contribution of functional or
demographic diversity among species. This model is the culmination of
a long debate on the role of stochastic and non-equilibrium processes
in plant community ecology: processes that can maintain species
numbers with unstable turnover of species identity and relative
abundance

These contrasting models offer very different explanations [Ackerly:1999, Ackerly:2000]_ for
diversity, and predictions regarding the factors that will influence
diversity levels. The symmetric model explains diversity in terms of
the balance of speciation/extinction in the meta-community and
immigration/extirpation in the local community.  The key attribute of
individual communities is their absolute size, in numbers of
individuals (`J`), and diversity is a monotonically increasing
function of `J`.  Total population size has long been recognized as
a key factor in population biology and population genetics, where
mutation and selection act as the diversity creating and culling
processes analogous to speciation and extinction. In community
ecology, however, the number of individuals has played a role in
empirical analyses implicitly through area or explicitly through
sample size, but total community size has not played a central role
in community ecology theory [Bond+van_Wilgen:1996, Schwilk+Kerr:2002, Schwilk:2003]_.
