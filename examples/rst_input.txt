Introduction
------------------

This introction will simply demonstrate some citations which can be
found in the `schwilk.bib` database.  To expand these citations or
produce a bibliography list, use `bib4txt.py`.  The output should
look like `testout.txt`.

Now for some citations. 
The maintenance of diversity stands as one of the great theoretical
challenges of ecology. The principle of competitive exclusion states
that two ecologically identical species cannot coexist indefinitely.
Niche theory provided the first solution to the coexistence problem,
based on the differentiation in resource use among co-existing
species and associated reduction in the intensity of interspecific
competition [MacArthur+Levins:1967, MacArthur:1970, Tilman:1980]_ .


In contrast, non niche-based models of diversity have
examined the role of stochastic dynamics and intrinsic
frequency-dependence, in the absence of explicit differences in
species' ecological parameters. Island biogeography theory was an
early example of a non niche-based theory.
Most recently, [Hubbell:2001]_ has introduced a neutral or
symmetric model of diversity based on stochastic demographic dynamics
in a large meta-community landscape. 

That should be enough for a test.
